# LOGLAS
Nowadays, the video game industry is constantly growing, and more and more people enjoy this hobby. For this reason, “Loglas”, a web-based multiplayer gaming platform, has been developed. This project combines different types of games including true/false questions and multiple-choice questions, which are interactively designed. The content of these questions is didactic so that new knowledge on different topics can be acquired. This project has used programming knowledge based on different languages and the techniques and tools of software engineering and systematic project management. This whole process has been developed using Scrum a method of managing tasks and workflows in order to obtain the best possible result of our project.
